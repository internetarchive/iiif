Tuttie, and  the  other  troops  assembled  for  marching.  Here  my  troop  had  the honor  of  turning  out  more  men  than  all  the  rest  of  the  county.  Ready  <IA_FTS_MATCH>to</IA_FTS_MATCH> march  after  taking  leave  of  my  friends  and  taking  dinner.  We  marched from  the  parade  under  repeated  shouts  of  applause  from  our  ftillow  citizens, a  great  number  of  whom  had  assembled  on  the  occasion.  It  afforded  me much  <IA_FTS_MATCH>pleasure</IA_FTS_MATCH>  <IA_FTS_MATCH>to</IA_FTS_MATCH>  <IA_FTS_MATCH>observe</IA_FTS_MATCH>  the  spirit  with  which  the  troops  marched  off,  and as  we  left  the  Green  we  returned  three  cheers  <IA_FTS_MATCH>to</IA_FTS_MATCH>  our  friends.  We  pro- ceeded by  Baskingridge  <IA_FTS_MATCH>to</IA_FTS_MATCH>  Dead  River,  where  we  encamped  for  the  night. Most  of  our  men  lay  in  barns,  and  appear  very  happy  ;  for  my  own  part,  T tumbled  on  a  bed  with  my  clothes  on,  <IA_FTS_MATCH>to</IA_FTS_MATCH>  be  ready  for  the  morning's  march, which  I  had  ordered  at  daylight.",
