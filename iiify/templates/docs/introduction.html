    <h2><a name="intro-iiif">What is IIIF?</a></h2>
    <p>
      IIIF is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Itâ€™s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs in various contexts. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions. For more details and examples, check out the <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF website</a>, or the <a href="https://iiif.io/api">full API specifications</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For a very high-level overview see <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/">"How IIIF Works"</a> published by the IIIF Consortium.</p>

    <h2><a name="intro-importance">Why?</a></h2>
    <p>
      The goal of IIIF is interoperability: to make an
      institution's image and audio/visual openly accessible resources available and easily reusable in a variety of web viewers and players without the need for any special plugins or software.
