    <p>
      Querying the root of the Internet Archive IIIF API
      results in a list of all publicly available items. Some items which are indexed in our search
      engine but do have no associated content files will result in an
      Internal Server Error. There are also a small number of items returned that do not have material types associted with them that are IIIF compatible. You can confirm whether the resource
      actually exists or not by visiting the item's /details page on
      archive.org.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="resources-types">Item Types</a></h2>
    <p>
      Items available through the this service include Images, Books,
      Audio, and Movie materials. This means any item on archive.org which has a
      `mediatype` of `texts`, `image`, `audio`, or `movie`, which can be verified through
      the <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2013/07/04/metadata-api/">metadata
      API</a>.</p>

      <p>There are some edge cases where rare file types are not represented in the IIIF presentation manifest. If you encounter an item where you think this may be the case, contact <a href="mailto:support@archive.org">support</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="retrieving-manifests">Retrieving a manifest for an item</a></h2>

    <p>Every Internet Archive item has a "details" page that is the main page for that item.</p>
    <p>
     The "details" page will have the word "details" in the URL, like in this example: 
      <pre><a href="https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009">https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009</a></pre></p>
      
    <p>What you'll need to get the IIIF manifest for any Internet Archive item is the identifier, which is the alphanumeric part of the URL that follows the "/details/" part. </p>

    <p>So, from our example just above, the Internet Archive identifier for that item is: <pre>img-8664_202009</pre></p>

    <p>To then get the IIIF manifest, plug in the ID to the following template:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/3/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</div>

    <p>For the example above, the final IIIF manifest URL would be:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/3/img-8664_202009/manifest.json</div>

<h3>Note about IIIF Presentation API versions</h3>
<p>
  The pattern above describes the way to return IIIF Presentation API 3.0 manifests, as denoted by the <b>/3/</b> in the URL. </p>
  <p>The manifest URL can also be used with the version number removed (<span class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</span>), though note that with any future updates that URL will always return the most current version of the Presentation API.</p>


  <p>The older experimental version of the IIIF APIs for Internet Archive materials hosted on Archivelabs served up IIIF Presentation API version 2.1 manifests; see below for instructions on retrieving a legacy manifests.</p>
