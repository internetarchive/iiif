    <h2><a name="resources-types">Item Types</a></h2>
    <p>
      Items available through the this service include Images, Books,
      Audio, and Movie materials. This means any item on archive.org which has a
      `mediatype` of `texts`, `image`, `audio`, or `movie`.</p>

      <p>For more pointers on how IIIF manifests can be used for different material types, see the Appendix section on <a href="#helpers">Helpers</a>.</p>

      <p>There are some edge cases where rare file types are not represented in the IIIF presentation manifest. If you encounter an item where you think this may be the case, <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif/issues">open an issue on the Github repository</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="retrieving-manifests"></a>Retrieving a manifest for an item</h2>

    <p>Every Internet Archive item has a "details" page that is the main page for that item.</p>
    <p>
     The "details" page will have the word "details" in the URL, like in this example: 
      <pre><a href="https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009">https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009</a></pre></p>
      
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>What you'll need to get the IIIF manifest for any Internet Archive item is the identifier, which is the alphanumeric part of the URL that follows the "/details/" part. </p>

    <p>So, from our example just above, the Internet Archive identifier for that item is: <pre>img-8664_202009</pre></p>

    <p>To then get the IIIF manifest, plug in the ID to the following template:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</div>

    <p>For the example above, the final IIIF manifest URL would be:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/img-8664_202009/manifest.json</div>

<h3>Note about IIIF Presentation API versions</h3>
<p>
  The pattern above describes the way to return IIIF Presentation API 3.0 manifests, as denoted by the <b>/3/</b> in the URL. </p>
  <p>The manifest URL can also be used with the version number removed (<span>https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</span>), though note that with any future updates that URL will always return the most current version of the Presentation API.</p>


  <p>The older experimental version of the IIIF APIs for Internet Archive materials hosted on Archivelabs served up IIIF Presentation API version 2.1 manifests; <a href="#appendix">see below for instructions on retrieving a legacy manifests</a>.</p>
