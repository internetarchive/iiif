    <p>
      The Internet Archive IIIF API service that launched in 2015 was an alpha service that has now been officially adopted as of September 2023.  While stable, it is still under development and we welcome community feedback on desired features.</p>

      <p>The code and logic that runs these APIs is available on <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif/">Github</a>, and that's where any <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif/issues">issues identified such as bugs or feature requests can be added</a>.</p>

    <h3>IDs</h3>
    <p>
      ID placeholders are preceded by a ":" in examples. IDs need not
      appear in bold, however this is done in the following example for
      emphasis:
    </p>

    <div class="request">
      GET {{ request.url_root }}<strong>:id</strong>
    </div>    
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2><a name="overview-schema">Schema</a></h2>
    <p>
      All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the
      {{ request.url_root }} domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
  $ curl -i {{ request.url_root }}/iiif

  HTTP/2 200 
  alt-svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000
  cache-control: max-age=900
  content-type: application/json
  date: Mon, 14 Aug 2023 20:53:06 GMT
  server: Caddy
  server: nginx/1.23.2
  content-length: 122082

  {
    ...
  }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Trailing Slashes</h3>
    <p>
      Other than the server root, uris should <strong>not</strong> end
      with trailing slashes.
    </p>
