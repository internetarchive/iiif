    <p>
      The Internet Archive IIIF API service that launched in 2015 was an alpha service that has now been officially adopted. 
      However, it is still under development and we welcome community feedback on desired features.</p>

    <h3>IDs</h3>
    <p>
      ID placeholders are preceded by a ":" in examples. IDs need not
      appear in bold, however this is done in the following example for
      emphasis:
    </p>

    <div class="request">
      GET {{ request.url_root }}<strong>:id</strong>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="overview-schema">Schema</a></h2>
    <p>
      All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the
      {{ request.url_root }} domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
  $ curl -i {{ request.url_root }}/iiif
