    <p>
      The Internet Archive IIIF API service that launched in 2015 was an alpha service that has now been officially adopted as of September 2023.  While stable, it is still under development and we welcome community feedback on desired features.</p>

      <p>The code and logic that runs these APIs is available on <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif/">Github</a>, and that's where any <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif/issues">issues identified such as bugs or feature requests can be added</a>.</p>

    <h4>IDs</h4>
    <p>
      ID placeholders are preceded by a ":" in examples. IDs need not
      appear in bold, however this is done in the following example for
      emphasis:
    </p>

    <div class="request">
      GET {{ request.url_root }}iiif/3/<strong>:id</strong>/manifest.json
    </div>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

  <section>
  <p>Nearly all image, text, audio and movie items available from the Internet Archive now have an associated
      mechanism for accessing them via IIIF APIs. This means you can seamlessly view nearly any Archive.org
      image or book in any compatible IIIF viewer and also enjoy
      the enhancements they provide (annotation, side-by-size viewing,
      and loading images from different institutions into the same
      space).
    </p>

    <p>
      The service also provides a mechanism for producing permanantly
      citeable image tiles of any arbitrary region of any image or book
      found in the Internet Archive.
    </p>

    <p>In IIIF terms, this functionality is accomplished via two APIs: <b>the Image API</b>, and <b>the Presentation API</b>.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="image-api"></a>Image API</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/">Image API</a> is an
      interface capable of producing and serving arbitrary tiles of
      arbitrary regions of an image (just like the different scales of resolution in Google Maps). The properties
      of these image tiles are specified within a URL, allowing
      permenant citation and retrieval at a later time.
      The Image API supports and powers other computer applications
      (like <a href="https://universalviewer.io/">deep-zoomable image
  viewers</a>, <a href="https://projectmirador.org/">comparison viewers</a>, and <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">more</a>).
    </p>

    <p>The Image API creates images using the following template: </p>
      <div class="request">{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}</div>
    <p>In the context of the Internet Archive items, that will look like this for a full image:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/3/<b>:id+filename</b>/full/max/0/default.jpg</div>

    <p>A request for a bitonal center-cropped square image 375 pixels on each side, rotated 45 degrees will look like this:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/3/<b>:id+filename</b>/square/375,/45/bitonal.jpg</div>

    <p>See the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/#4-image-requests">Image API section on "Image Requests"</a> for more details on how images can be manipulated and specific sizes or sections retrieved.</p>

    <p>IIIF Image Viewers read something called an "info.json" file, which lets them know how to process the image for deep zooming.</p>

    <p>For a single-image Internet Archive item, you can generate the info.json via the following route:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/info.json</div>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Taking one item as an example (<a href="https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009">https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009</a>), the info.json would be:</p>
<div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/3/img-8664_202009%2FIMG_8664.jpg/info.json</div>
<p>And the full URL for the image would be:</p>
<div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/3/img-8664_202009%2FIMG_8664.jpg/full/max/0/default.jpg</div>
<p>A cropped portion at the full resolution can be requested like this:</p>
<div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/3/img-8664_202009%2fIMG_8664.jpg/<b>1100,904,704,664</b>/max/0/default.jpg</div>
<p>Where "1100,904,704,664" in that URL stands for 1100 pixels from the left edge, 904 pixels from the bottom edge, 704 pixels is the width of the desired section, and 664 pixels is the height.</p>


<p>Because it can be time-consuming to manually generate the IIIF Image API URLs, we recommend a IIIF helper tool that can help you identify the Image API URLs for a corresponding IA item. One such tool is Glen Robson's <a href="https://glenrobson.github.io/CanvasFinder/">Canvas Finder</a>, which takes as input a Manifest URL (see below for how to find that).</p>

<p>More image tools can be found via the community supported <a href="https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif/#image-tools">Awesome IIIF list</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="presentation-api"></a>Presentation API</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/">Presentation
  API</a> allows institutions to publish and consume metadata about
      collections and sequences of digital objects, called "manifests." For images and texts, this is almost always used in conjunction with the IIIF Image API to create manifests for digital objects that any IIIF viewer can use to present an engaging deep-zoom experience.</p>

      <p>The Presentation API can also faciliate the portability and playback of time-based media like audio and video files. In the A/V context, IIIF manifests often present multiple playback options based on the media formats and quality types available.</p>
      
      <p>A manifest for an Internet Archive items look like this:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</div>
