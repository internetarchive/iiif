    <h2><a name="resources-listing">Listing all items</a></h2>
    <p>
      Querying the root of the Internet Archive IIIF API
      results in a list of all publicly available items. Some items which are indexed in our search
      engine but do have no associated content files will result in an
      Internal Server Error. There are also a small number of items returned that do not have material types associated with them that are IIIF compatible. You can confirm whether the resource
      actually exists or not by visiting the item's /details page on
      archive.org.

    <h2><a name="helpers">Helpers for various media types</a></h2>
    <p>
      To give you a sense of how different media types on the Internet Archive can be used in IIIF viewers, we've created a set of item "helpers" that provide some useful iformation and links.
    </p>
    <p>The pattern for these helper pages is as follows:</p>
   <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/helper/<b>:id</b> </div>

<p>So, for example, the helper page for <a href="https://archive.org/details/img-8664_202009">a single image item</a> with item id <b>img-8664_202009</b> would be the following:</p>
<div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/helper/img-8664_202009</div>

<p>The helper page for this <a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-7w8F2Xi3vFw">movie item</a> with item id <b>youtube-7w8F2Xi3vFw</b> would be the following:</p>
<div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/helper/youtube-7w8F2Xi3vFw</div>

<p>Not all media types on the Internet Archive have files that are playable in IIIF viewers, but the helper pages should work for images, texts, audio, and movie items.</p>
