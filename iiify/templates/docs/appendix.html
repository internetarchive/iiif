    <p>
      Querying the root of the Internet Archive IIIF API
      results in a list of all publicly available items. Some items which are indexed in our search
      engine but do have no associated content files will result in an
      Internal Server Error. There are also a small number of items returned that do not have material types associated with them that are IIIF compatible. You can confirm whether the resource
      actually exists or not by visiting the item's /details page on
      archive.org.
